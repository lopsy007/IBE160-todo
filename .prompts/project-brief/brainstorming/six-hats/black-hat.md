One of the downsides could be that the student is not able to fulfill the tasks in time and thereby losing hope or getting more pessimistic or even getting sad because you know you're not able to do the tasks. You're getting the feeling of not being successful.

The app might just be another app which steals the time of the students, so it really needs to be easy to use. It shouldn't take up too much time from the student because then it kind of defeats its purpose.

There could be too many applications that you need to put in the same data. Like in a calendar, you get notifications from teachers or employees. It kind of gets mixed up all together, and as a person, you get too many programs to keep track of. The lack of integration with other applications would be a risk.
