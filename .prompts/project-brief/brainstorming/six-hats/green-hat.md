When the students have non-completed tasks after the deadline, the application should encourage the students instead of just telling them: "Oh, you didn't do this in this task. You have to try to spur the student on to motivate the student to actually do better next time."

Keep it simple, stupid! Like the **KISS paradigm**, it's important for the student not to spend too much time in this app. The student should get quick reminders (positive reminders) but the student shouldn't be spending too much time in the application.

Like, for instance, we can have this student just speak to the computer and it creates the task quickly. Like having an AI engine in the application to help create tasks quickly and easily.

Being able to **share your to-dos with friends or colleagues** would be a nice thing in order to get support from your friends and also that they can share you up when you're not able to keep the deadlines. You should be able to choose what you want to share with a friend.

A nice thing could be that we get help to **rewrite tasks** so they become more suited for your personality or the student's personality. And also inspired from formulations for smart targets.
