Very often, students have a tendency of not being able to keep their planned tasks in due time and getting this feeling of not being able to be successful, not completing everything, always having the feeling that you're behind. The feeling that there are not enough hours in the day to accomplish all your tasks. The satisfaction of actually being able to do the tasks as planned will motivate the student to do another task and to do another task and to do another task, getting the overall feeling of being successful. It often starts with one task. If you're able to fulfill this task, you will be a little bit more motivated to do the next task, and so forth. It's like a progressive way of becoming more and more satisfied. My gut feeling is that if we are able to give the user or the student the feeling of motivating the student to actually complete their tasks, that would be a successful application. Maybe we can turn it into a game, for instance, between the application and the student.
