The app should have a great potential to give the student a sense of control and overview of their week or their day.

The app should also be able to help the student plan more realistically when it comes to the use of their time. It's very easy to plan too much that you actually have time to do. Very often there are overlapping tasks, which as a human being, you are not able to grasp before it's there, and you cannot do anything about it. And you also have to take into consideration that everyone has to get enough sleep.
