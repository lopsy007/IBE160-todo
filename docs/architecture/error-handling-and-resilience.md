# Error Handling & Resilience

-   **Frontend:** API call errors will be caught in the service layer. The UI will display user-friendly error messages and allow the user to retry the action.
-   **Backend:** API routes will use a centralized error handling middleware. Errors will be logged, and a standardized error response will be sent to the client.
-   **Resilience:** Given the serverless nature of Vercel and Supabase, the infrastructure is inherently resilient. If a function fails, it will not affect other functions.
