# Monitoring and Observability

-   **Frontend:** Vercel Analytics will be used to monitor Core Web Vitals and page views.
-   **Backend:** Vercel's function logs will be used for basic logging and debugging of API routes.
-   **Error Tracking:** For more advanced error tracking, a service like Sentry or LogRocket can be integrated in the future.
