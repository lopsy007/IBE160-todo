# To-Do Application for Students Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Goals and Background Context

### Goals

*   Develop a to-do application that is motivating and enjoyable for university students.
*   Increase student productivity and provide a sense of accomplishment.
*   Achieve high user adoption and engagement within the target student demographic.
*   Validate the hypothesis that a positive reinforcement model increases task completion rates.
*   Establish the application as a "cool" and essential tool for student productivity.

### Background Context

University students are overwhelmed with managing academic, social, and work-related tasks. Existing to-do applications are often generic, not engaging, and fail to integrate with student-specific platforms. This leads to a feeling of being overwhelmed and unsuccessful.

This project aims to solve this by creating a to-do application focused on positive reinforcement and simplicity. The core idea is to build a motivational tool that celebrates achievements and handles missed deadlines with encouragement. By creating a fun, simple, and integrated experience, the application will help students feel in control and accomplished.

## 3. User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The UX vision is to create an experience that is effortless, encouraging, and delightful. The app should feel less like a chore and more like a supportive companion. The focus is on celebrating progress and fostering a positive mindset towards tasks and responsibilities.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

*   **Simplicity:** A minimal set of features, presented in a clean and uncluttered interface.
*   **Positive Reinforcement:** Use of animations, sounds, and haptic feedback to make completing tasks satisfying.
*   **Voice-first (Post-MVP):** Prioritizing voice as a primary input method to reduce friction.

### Core Screens and Views

*   **Today View:** A focused view of tasks due today.
*   **All Tasks View:** A list of all upcoming and overdue tasks.
*   **Completed Tasks View:** A "wall of fame" showcasing all completed tasks.
*   **Task Creation Screen:** A simple form to add a new task.
*   **Settings Screen:** Basic app settings.

### Accessibility

*   **WCAG AA:** The application should meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines.

### Branding

*   The branding should be modern, clean, and appeal to a young adult audience. It should feel "cool" and "intriguing", not corporate or sterile. The tone should be encouraging and friendly.

### Target Device and Platforms

*   **Mobile Only:** The initial focus is on native iOS and Android applications.

## 4. Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure

*   **Monorepo:** A single repository will be used to manage the frontend, backend, and infrastructure code.

### Service Architecture

*   **Serverless:** A serverless architecture using cloud functions (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions) will be adopted for the backend to ensure scalability and cost-effectiveness.

### Testing Requirements

*   **Unit + Integration:** The project will include unit tests for individual components and integration tests for key workflows.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

*   **Cross-Platform Framework:** A cross-platform framework like React Native or Flutter should be used for mobile app development to maintain a single codebase for iOS and Android.
*   **Database:** A NoSQL database like Firestore or DynamoDB is preferred for flexibility and scalability.
*   **Authentication:** A third-party authentication provider (e.g., Firebase Authentication, Auth0) should be used to handle user login.
*   **CI/CD:** A CI/CD pipeline should be set up from the beginning to automate testing and deployment.

## 5. Epic List

*   **Epic 1: Foundation & Core Task Management:** Establish the project foundation, including the mobile app shell, backend services, database, and basic task CRUD functionality.
*   **Epic 2: The Motivational Loop:** Implement the core positive reinforcement features, including celebrations for completed tasks and the non-punitive handling of overdue tasks.
*   **Epic 3: User Experience & Polish:** Refine the user interface, add animations and transitions, and improve the overall user experience.
*   **Epic 4 (Post-MVP): Calendar Integration:** Integrate with external calendar APIs (Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar) to sync tasks.
*   **Epic 5 (Post-MVP): Social & Voice Features:** Implement social sharing and voice-based task creation.
