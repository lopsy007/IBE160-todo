# 1. Goals and Background Context

### Goals

*   Develop a to-do application that is motivating and enjoyable for university students.
*   Increase student productivity and provide a sense of accomplishment.
*   Achieve high user adoption and engagement within the target student demographic.
*   Validate the hypothesis that a positive reinforcement model increases task completion rates.
*   Establish the application as a "cool" and essential tool for student productivity.

### Background Context

University students are overwhelmed with managing academic, social, and work-related tasks. Existing to-do applications are often generic, not engaging, and fail to integrate with student-specific platforms. This leads to a feeling of being overwhelmed and unsuccessful.

This project aims to solve this by creating a to-do application focused on positive reinforcement and simplicity. The core idea is to build a motivational tool that celebrates achievements and handles missed deadlines with encouragement. By creating a fun, simple, and integrated experience, the application will help students feel in control and accomplished.
