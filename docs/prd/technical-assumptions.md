# 4. Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure

*   **Monorepo:** A single repository will be used to manage the frontend, backend, and infrastructure code.

### Service Architecture

*   **Serverless:** A serverless architecture using cloud functions (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions) will be adopted for the backend to ensure scalability and cost-effectiveness.

### Testing Requirements

*   **Unit + Integration:** The project will include unit tests for individual components and integration tests for key workflows.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

*   **Cross-Platform Framework:** A cross-platform framework like React Native or Flutter should be used for mobile app development to maintain a single codebase for iOS and Android.
*   **Database:** A NoSQL database like Firestore or DynamoDB is preferred for flexibility and scalability.
*   **Authentication:** A third-party authentication provider (e.g., Firebase Authentication, Auth0) should be used to handle user login.
*   **CI/CD:** A CI/CD pipeline should be set up from the beginning to automate testing and deployment.
