# 3. User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The UX vision is to create an experience that is effortless, encouraging, and delightful. The app should feel less like a chore and more like a supportive companion. The focus is on celebrating progress and fostering a positive mindset towards tasks and responsibilities.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

*   **Simplicity:** A minimal set of features, presented in a clean and uncluttered interface.
*   **Positive Reinforcement:** Use of animations, sounds, and haptic feedback to make completing tasks satisfying.
*   **Voice-first (Post-MVP):** Prioritizing voice as a primary input method to reduce friction.

### Core Screens and Views

*   **Today View:** A focused view of tasks due today.
*   **All Tasks View:** A list of all upcoming and overdue tasks.
*   **Completed Tasks View:** A "wall of fame" showcasing all completed tasks.
*   **Task Creation Screen:** A simple form to add a new task.
*   **Settings Screen:** Basic app settings.

### Accessibility

*   **WCAG AA:** The application should meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines.

### Branding

*   The branding should be modern, clean, and appeal to a young adult audience. It should feel "cool" and "intriguing", not corporate or sterile. The tone should be encouraging and friendly.

### Target Device and Platforms

*   **Mobile Only:** The initial focus is on native iOS and Android applications.
